# TROVA: TRansport Of water VApor

TRansport Of water VApor (TROVA) is a software developed in Python and Fortran for the study of moisture sources and sinks. This allows the use of the FLEXible PARTicle global dispersion model and the FLEXPART-WRF regional model at different spatial resolutions. They also include the methodologies of Sthol and James (2005) and Sodemann et al. (2008).
